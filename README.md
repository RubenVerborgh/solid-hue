[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/solid-hue.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/solid-hue)

ðŸ’¡ Control your [Philips Hue Lights](https://www.philips-hue.com/)
from within [Solid](https://solidproject.org/) applications.


## What it is
- The [Community Solid Server](https://github.com/solid/community-server/)
  allows people to expose their data on the Web behind access control.
- This `philips-hue` npm package provides a plug-in store for the Community Solid Server
  that exposes your Philips Hue lights as read/write documents.
- Solid apps can thereby access your light setup
  as if they would access any other document.

```shell
mkdir my-server
cd my-server
